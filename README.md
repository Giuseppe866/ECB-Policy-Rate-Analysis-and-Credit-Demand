# ECB Policy Rates and Credit Demand in the Eurozone (2019–2024)

This repository contains the analysis of the relationship between **ECB policy rates** and **credit volumes** in the Eurozone between 2019 and 2024.  
The study examines how monetary policy decisions are transmitted to households and firms, especially during periods of global shocks such as the **COVID-19 pandemic** and the **Russia-Ukraine war**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate how ECB interest rate decisions affect credit demand by analyzing:  

- **ECB Policy Rates**: Main Refinancing Operations (MRO), Marginal Lending Facility (MLF), Deposit Facility Rate (DFR).  
- **Household Credit Volumes**: Loans granted to families for personal and non-mortgage purposes.  
- **Firm Credit Volumes**: Wholesale loans to non-household sectors.  
- **Total Credit Market**: Combined household and firm lending volumes.  

The analysis covers both separate datasets (households vs firms) and the aggregated euro-area credit market, with decomposed time series and regression models used to highlight structural patterns.

## Key Metrics

- **MRO (Main Refinancing Operations Rate)**: Core ECB weekly lending rate.  
- **MLF (Marginal Lending Facility Rate)**: Overnight lending rate, acting as an upper bound.  
- **DFR (Deposit Facility Rate)**: Overnight deposit rate, currently the ECB’s main instrument.  
- **Credit Volumes**: Evolution of household, firm, and total euro-area lending (2019–2024).  

## Results

- **ECB Policy Rates**:  
  - 2019–mid 2022: Extremely low levels (MRO at 0%, DFR negative).  
  - From mid 2022: Sharp rate hikes, with DFR becoming the key policy tool.  

- **Household Credit**:  
  - Gradual increase from 2019 to 2022.  
  - Stabilization just above €5 trillion post-2023, showing resilience despite higher rates.  

- **Firm Credit**:  
  - Growth until early 2023, then plateau around €6.3 trillion.  
  - More sensitive to monetary tightening than household credit.  

- **Total Credit Market**:  
  - Expanded from ~€10.2 trillion in 2019 to ~€11.5 trillion by early 2023.  
  - Flattened afterwards, illustrating the delayed impact of ECB rate hikes.  

- **Regression Findings**:  
  - Significant intercepts across models, confirming **structural demand for credit** regardless of rate levels.  
  - Monetary policy slows growth but does not eliminate the baseline need for loans.  

## Conclusion

The euro-area credit market demonstrates that:  
- ECB interest rates are the primary channel of monetary policy transmission.  
- Credit growth slowed sharply after 2022 but remained structurally positive.  
- Household lending is less elastic to rate changes than firm credit, highlighting essential and resilient demand.  
- The 2022–2024 tightening cycle illustrates how monetary policy gradually influences lending volumes without triggering an abrupt collapse.
